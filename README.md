# SatelliteLaunch

Project no. 5 - Satellite Launch

Given a simple (two-dimensional) model of a planetary system, prepare a program that given an
origin planet, calculates the time, direction vector and speed needed to launch a satellite, so
that it flies close to a given destination planet.
Assume that we are only interested in the gravitational interactions of the planets with the
satellite and that all planets have the same mass.
Input:
• Initial (time 𝑡 = 0) positions of the planets (we may assume circular orbits)
  (𝑟1 ,𝜙1),… , (𝑟𝑁,𝜙𝑁) in polar coordinates and their orbital periods 𝑝1,… ,𝑝𝑁,
• the index of the origin and destination planets,
• the distance within which the satellite needs pass next to the destination planet,
• the maximum allowed flight time.
Output: time, angle, and satellite launch speed.
